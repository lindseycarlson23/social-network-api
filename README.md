  ## Description
  
  For this project, I created the backend  for a social network application using MongoDB, Mongoose, and Node. I was not given any starter code, and I created an app where you can created user accounts, add other users as friends, add thoughts and reactions to thoughts. And of course delete or modify all of those. I use Insomnia to demonstrate this functionality.
